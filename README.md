To run the project:

streamlit run <app_name.py>






Short answer, NO. But you can share the venv build scripts.

    pip freeze all libraries to a requirements.txt file.

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

    Create the venv on each OS:

    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all the libs.
