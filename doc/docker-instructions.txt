Build the Docker image: Once you have created the Dockerfile, you can use the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t <image-tag-name> .

(This command will build an image based on the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag it with the specified name)

Run the Docker container: Once the image is built, you can run the container using the following command:

docker run -p 8051:8051 <image-name>

(This command maps port 4000 on the host to port 80 on the container and starts the container)
